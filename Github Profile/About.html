                  <h1 class = "titleAbout">ABOUT ME</h1>
                  <p class = "para">Hi! I am Menard Luis I. Caponpon and I am a 3rd year BSIT Student from Batangas State University - The National Engineering University.
                                    We are four in the family and I have a younger brother who is a also student in BatStateU. I love playing online games, playing Basketball, and playing guitar. 
                                    I am a very quiet person and Iâ€™d rather be alone in a room than go out and party. 
                                    I choose this course Information Technology because of my friends back there in my high school life I was influenced by them to take the track ICT and I thought back then that there was no math in that strand so I choose ICT even if my dream job is to become a civil engineer someday.
                                    As the time goes by, I really enjoyed in studying in this track that I choose and I am glad that that I became a part of this school as a CICS student and I will continue to study hard to finish what I have started and to achieve my goals in life.</p>

                    <p class = "educs">I started my school life when I was four years old as a daycare student at Calubcub 1st Elementary School.
                                       After that I go to kindergarten at a private school called Jodeph Marello Institute (JMI)
                                       and I go back to Calubcub 1st Elementary School to continue my study as a grade 1 student and I finished my elementary days at Calubcub 1st Elementary school also.
                                       After that I started my highschool life at Joseph Marello Institute and finished Senior High School at the same school.
                                       Then I enter the tertiary education which is college at Batangas State University and I am honored that I am a third year student now at the same school and hopefully become an allumni here and finally become successfull someday.
